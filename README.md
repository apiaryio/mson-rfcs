# MSON Request for Comments

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent
and controlled path for new features or changes to MSON. The RFC process allows
all changes to be put though a design process and produce consensus.

## When you need to follow this process

You need to follow this process if you intend to make changes to
MSON.

## What the process is

In short, to get a changes added to MSON, one must first get an RFC relevant
to that change merged and accepted into the RFC repository as a markdown file.
At that point the RFC is 'active' and may be implemented with the goal of
eventual inclusion into MSON.

Please see [RFC 1](rfcs/0001-rfc-process.md) for more details.

The RFC process is inspired by, and very similar to
[PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/), [DEP](https://github.com/django/deps)
and the [Rust RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).
